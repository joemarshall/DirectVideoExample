# Example Unreal project for DirectVideo plugin

This loads a single 360 video and displays it. This branch is set to build for Meta Quest 2 or 3, but if you disable the Meta XR plugin it should build for standard Android devices.

If you build it without the plugin installed on your engine, it will fall back to standard Android media player, and you will be able to see that Unreal can't play high resolution video at any decent framerate.
