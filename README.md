# Example Unreal project for DirectVideo plugin

This loads a single 360 video and displays it. Currently set to build for Pico VR, but if you disable the Pico XR plugin it should build for standard Android devices.

If you build it without the plugin installed on your engine, it will fall back to standard Android media player, and you will be able to see that Unreal can't play high resolution video at any decent framerate.
